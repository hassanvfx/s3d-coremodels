# CoreModels

This repository contains simple structs for User, Session, and MediaItem. In this basic implementation, all properties are public and we have added some illustrative test cases and demo app implementation. In a large production codebase, we can create more advanced initializers, adaptors, or even define them through a protocol-oriented design.

## Seed Enum

The CoreModels also implements the Seed enum which provides static access to seed data. This can be particularly useful for testing and development purposes.
